# hacker-rank-java
Command-line Java Application where I run HackerRank challenges.

It is possible to choose which challenge to run, see it's output and compare it to the expected output.

For each challenge there is a solution file, an input and an expected output .txt files that were taken from HackerRank.

**_Note: It still is in a very early development stage._**
